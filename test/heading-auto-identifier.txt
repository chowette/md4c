# Heading auto identifiers

With the flag `MD_FLAG_HEADINGAUTOID`, MD4C generate an identifier for a heading.

```````````````````````````````` example
# heading
.
<h1 id="heading">heading</h1>
````````````````````````````````

Spaces are replaced by `-` and upercase are replaced by lower case 

```````````````````````````````` example
# The Heading
.
<h1 id="the-heading">The Heading</h1>
````````````````````````````````

The non-alphanumeric characters are discarded except for `-.

```````````````````````````````` example
# The %@!= stupid _ heading !
.
<h1 id="the--stupid--heading-">The %@!= stupid _ heading !</h1>
````````````````````````````````

As a result, you can get some empty heading with no identifier.

```````````````````````````````` example
# !
.
<h1>!</h1>
````````````````````````````````

Heading srting with number are not treated differently

```````````````````````````````` example
# 1.1 The start
.
<h1 id="11-the-start">1.1 The start</h1>
````````````````````````````````
