# Heading auto identifiers

With the flag `MD_FLAG_HEADINGAUTOID`, MD4C generate an identifier for a heading.

```````````````````````````````` example
# heading
.
<h1 id="heading">heading</h1>
````````````````````````````````

Spaces are replaced by `-` and upercase are replaced by lower case 

```````````````````````````````` example
# The Heading
.
<h1 id="the-heading">The Heading</h1>
````````````````````````````````

Unicode characters can also be put lower case

```````````````````````````````` example
# ĀĄŁŇŢŰŽבあИЯ
.
<h1 id="āąłňţűžבあия">ĀĄŁŇŢŰŽבあИЯ</h1>
````````````````````````````````


The non-alphanumeric characters are discarded except for `-.

```````````````````````````````` example
# The %@!= stupid _ heading !
.
<h1 id="the--stupid--heading-">The %@!= stupid _ heading !</h1>
````````````````````````````````

As a result, you can get some empty heading with no identifier.

```````````````````````````````` example
# !
.
<h1>!</h1>
````````````````````````````````

Heading starting with numbers are not treated differently

```````````````````````````````` example
# 1.1 The start
.
<h1 id="11-the-start">1.1 The start</h1>
````````````````````````````````

Heading can contain link inside

```````````````````````````````` example
# Title with a [link](hidden) inside  
.
<h1 id="title-with-a-link-inside">Title with a <a href="hidden">link</a> inside</h1>
````````````````````````````````

Heading can contain wiki link inside but requiere the MD_FLAG_WIKILINKS  

```````````````````````````````` example
# Title with a [[hidden-wiki|link]] inside  
.
<h1 id="title-with-a-hidden-wikilink-inside">Title with a [[hidden-wiki|link]] inside</h1>
````````````````````````````````

Heading can contain formatting

```````````````````````````````` example
# Title with *emphasis* inside 
.
<h1 id="title-with-emphasis-inside">Title with <em>emphasis</em> inside</h1>
````````````````````````````````
